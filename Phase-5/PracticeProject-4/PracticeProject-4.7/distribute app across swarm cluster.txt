Step 1: Create one Master and One Worker Instance
	copy key (.pem file) connect it to mobaXterm

step 2: install docker on both instances
	do docker login to connect it with docker hub

step 3: set up hosts config file

	>sudo vi /etc/hosts  
	>press i to insert
	
	type privateIpOfMatser master
	     privateIpOfWorker worker1

	esc
	:wq!
	enter
step 4: check file updated or not by executing ping command

	ping master
	ctrl + c (to stop)
	ping worker1
	ctrl + c (to stop)

step 5: init swarm
	(if previously already initiated a swarm them first realese your node from that swarm by using below command >docker swarm leave --force)

	> docker swarm init --advertise-addr  172.31.29.193 (Ip address of master node)
	
	you will get one link that execute on worker node to join this swarm
(docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-2g2fziuh84lfp8m9e1sh1ru6ndiqh9pcfh2jpitolgwoujxrcs-33fr36zpq3mkxalnun74mu1ue 172.31.29.193:2377)

	> docker swarm join --token (token number)
	(In your machine you will get diffrent link)

	>docker node ls (execute on master console)

Step 6: create service with 2 replicas

	>docker service create --name cluserservice --publish 8082:8082 --replicas 2 sonamsoni/myimage
	>docker service ps cluserservice

	you can check 2 services are running 
	1 is on master node
	1 is on worker node
