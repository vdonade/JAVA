Step-3: Changed access permissions
Add username in the User name* section. Select AWS Management Console access and select one of the ways to configure console password 
Either we can add user to the created group or we can add policy 
In case a user needs to add a policy first, then he or she needs to search and then add policy to the user 

Step-4: Added an identifier 
Add an identifier by adding key and value to tag each user 
It will create a user with a group or an added policy
